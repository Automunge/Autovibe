# Autovibe

This repo is intended as a startikg point in development of a template that can benused as a startingnpoint towards an (as yet undefined) coding project. Basically I am attempting to lay the foundation that can ne adapted to cloud based coding sessions in a manner suitable for the dev console of my choice (Github Codespaces hosted VSCode terminal accessed trough a Safari browser on iOS). In the currenr form it has established some conventioms for git integration into LLM MLOps that appear to have made it into the mainstream tooling during the short period after this project was initiated. It is not yet in a finished form but if a reader is interested in adapting towards a more polished state I suggest reading theougj the seperaye Notes.md file for various points of inquiry.
