# Autovibe
Running some experiments on codespace configurations for cloud based vibe coding dev environment. Limiting future citations towards human authored material. Targeting to run on ipad pro with monitor / mouse / keyboard, github codespaces with VSCode or jupyter in browser. Future extensions may include additional modules like database access, agentic LLM aggregations, optimizer components, SSH connections, TBD. Basically was looking for a new building project and while I hone in on what that will be wanted to start laying foundations. (I find the iOS operating system tends to be more stable than other resources so will try to work around whatever limitations come up using cloud resources where possible and leveraging reputable docker containers and libraries with a "minimalist" import bias.)

Some early experiments indicate that the use of VSCode in iOS browsers is not always a seemless experience. Even working with Apple branded products like the iPad pro with M4, Magic Keyboard, and Mouse the VSCode editor appears to intermittently drop keyboard access, particularly when running a jupyter notebook through VSCode. These appear to often be triggered by switching browser tabs. 

Fortunatgely the jupyterlabs convention for accessing jupyter notebooks appears to be beter supported on iOS web browsers. Not yet certain which iOS browser is best to default to, it appears that Safari may be suitable for jupyterlabs but Edge possibly has better stability for VSCode in browser. I think a reasonable workflow might be to keep both VSCode and Jupyter running in seperate tabs and rely on jupyter for notebook editting and VSCode for codespace management. Probably good practice to frequently save noteboks during editting or activating some kind of autosave feature.

After some experimentation and with support of LLM I settled on a devcontainer setup of seperate files for devcontainer.json and Dockerfile in the devcontainer folder, where my understanding is that when Github initiates to build an active codespace it starts by inspecting the devcontainer.json, which then routes to the Dockerfile where in this setup is listed a base docker/devcontainer image, currently sourced from a repository hosted by Microsoft, and after loading the base image (which comes prepopulated with python in a Ubuntu system). The Dockerfile then installs a couple of additional OS related modules (which I haven't gone through in detail yet) and then pip installs a few python packages which for this setup will serve as bulk of use for coding. Initially this setup will focus on python workflows but this kind of docker container is equally capable of initiallizing alternative programming environments (like C++, Rust, etc) since it is basically an encapsulated Unix system hosted on github servers. After completing the Dockerfile setups, the devcontainer.JSON as configurated here includes a few additional setup operations including initializing any API keys stored seperately in the github portal which has a codespaces option for such (which is helpful since if this docker container is adapted to other users or usecases it becomes possible to initialize a speerate API key for each user without needing to update the devcontainer). The devcontainer.json also populates a few VSCode extensions (which I haven't yet gone through in detail) and then intializes the '8888' port used for accessing jupyter in a seperate tab (8888 is a common plug value for this use).

Importantly, by initializing with a base devcontainer in a repoutable hosted repository (currently in a venue managed by Microsoft), we should be able to offload any Unix system management to their oversite which frees us to mainly focus on those libraries that we are interested in for vibe coding.

I also expect that the convention of using a Dockerfile for base OS and pip install and the the devcontainer.json for VSCode and additional supplemental modules should make it easier to manage tweaking this for different covnetions, since the two can be made fairly modular.

Note that the initialization of the Codespace appears to be somewhat difficult to troubleshoot when  the are formatting issues in the devcontainer components. One should pay special attention to things like basic JSON formatting.
