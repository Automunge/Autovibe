# Codespace_VibeCode_template_1
Running some experiments on codespace configurations for cloud based vibe coding dev environment. Limiting future citations towards human authored material. Targeting to run on ipad pro with monitor / mouse / keyboard, github codespaces with VSCode or jupyter in browser. Future extensions may include additional modules like database access, agentic LLM aggregations, optimizer components, SSH connections, TBD. Basically was looking for a new building project and while I hone in on what that will be wanted to start laying foundations. (I find the iOS operating system tends to be more stable than other resources so will try to work around whatever limitations come up using cloud resources where possible and leveraging reputable docker containers and libraries with a "minimalist" import bias.)
